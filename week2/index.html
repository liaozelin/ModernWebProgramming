	<h1>Lemon Meringue Pie</h1>

	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<blockquote>
		Lemon meringue pie is a type of baked pie, usually served for dessert, made with a crust usually made of shortcrust pastry, lemon custard filling and a fluffy meringue topping. Lemon meringue pie is prepared with a bottom pie crust, with the meringue directly on top of the lemon filling. No upper crust is used, as in a cherry pie.<br /><br />
